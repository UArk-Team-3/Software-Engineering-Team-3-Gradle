# Software-Engineering-Team-3-Gradle
 The Gradle build implementation of our project

# How to Run:
In order to run our project locally go to \app\build\libs\ and download "app.jar", then run "javac -jar app.jar" in the same directory as the "app.jar" executable. Dependencies are included in the executable so you shouldn't have to make any additional declartions.

To build the project locally download and install Gradle to your machine and add it to your PATH environment. From there in your cloned Team-3-Gradle directory you can run "gradle build" and "gradle run" in order to build and run our program.
